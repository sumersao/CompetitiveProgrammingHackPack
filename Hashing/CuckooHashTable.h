   * Constructs a new cuckoo hash table with the specified number of buckets,
   * using hash functions drawn from the indicated family of hash functions.
   *
   * Since cuckoo hashing requires two tables, you should create two tables
   * of size numBuckets / 2. Because our testing harness attempts to exercise
   * a number of different load factors, you should not change the number of
   * buckets once the hash table has initially be created.
   *
   * You can choose a hash function out of the family of hash functions by
   * declaring a variable of type HashFunction and assigning it the value
   * family->get(). For example:
   *
   *    HashFunction h;
   *    h = family->get();
   *
   * Because cuckoo hashing may require a rehash if elements can't be placed
   * into the table, you will need to store the hash family for later use.
   * You can do so by declaring a data member of type
   *
   *    std::shared_ptr<HashFamily>
   *
   * and assigning 'family' to it.
