Your task is to implement the functions defined in the five hash table types.

You can test your code interactively by running the program

   ./explore
   
and following the prompts. Once you think you have everything working,
you can execute our automated timing suite by running

   ./run-tests
   
from the command-line.

Once you've gotten everything working, crank the optimizer up to the max by
replacing -O0 -g in the Makefile with -Ofast -march=native and see what you
find! Remember that you need to include a writeup of your findings as part
of your problem set.
